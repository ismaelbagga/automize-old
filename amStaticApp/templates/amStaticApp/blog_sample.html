                At the beginning of the year, only the lazy would not get down to making
                a complex analysis of the previous year results. Consider us lazy then,
                since we don’t want to waste your time with bulky wording.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, we rake up the prominent numbers from Deloitte, Statista,
                WeAreSocial, CompTIA, Clutch and other sources to give you a brief
                insight on what challenges small and medium businesses came up with at
                the end of 2016, and how IT industry can help with the technology for
                business growth.

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Customers heavily rely on online and mobile.</li>
                <li>
                    Businesses, especially small ones, experience the lack of online
                    presence and have doubts about investing into web assets.
