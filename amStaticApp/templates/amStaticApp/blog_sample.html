                <p class="p1_bs">At the beginning of the year, only the lazy would not get down to making a complex analysis of the
                    previous year results. Consider us lazy then, since we don’t want to waste your time with bulky
                    wording. </p>
                <p class="p2_bs">Instead, we rake up the prominent numbers from Deloitte, Statista, WeAreSocial, CompTIA, Clutch and
                    other sources to give you a brief insight on what challenges small and medium businesses came up
                    with at the end of 2016, and how IT industry can help with the technology for business growth.</p>
