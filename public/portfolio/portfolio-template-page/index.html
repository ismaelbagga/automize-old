                ThinkDonate is a fundraising platform and the UK’s first # <br>
                donating brand that helps charities drive donations on social <br>
                media by inspiring supporters to give as they scroll, with new and <br>
                simple ways to donate. Heralded as ‘one of the top alternatives to <br>
                AmazonSmile’ by Charity Digital, ThinkDonate launched in 2022 with <br>
                some of the UK’s leading charities and has been powering donations <br>
                on social, web and offline ever since.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the early days, ThinkDonate needed to collaborate with a <br>
                highly skilled tech team to bring their vision to life and give <br>
                charities an easy-to-use platform that offers a range of tools to <br>
                engage supporters and drive donations.

              <p>
                ThinkDonate assigned Digiteum to design and develop a web <br>
                application for charities. The key goal was to create a secure and <br>
                easy-to-use platform where charities could set up fundraising <br>
                campaigns for different distribution channels, receive donations, <br>
                and track campaign performance — all in one place. Our <br>
                cross-functional team combined modular architecture, responsive <br>
                design, and modern tech stack (Node.js, Angular, AWS) to deliver a <br>
                high-performing feature-rich web app. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the app’s launch in 2022, ThinkDonate has onboarded dozens <br>
                of charities, including the Royal British Legion, British Deaf <br> 
                Association, and Disability Snowsport UK, and continues growing <br>
                its impact in the charity space.

                    ThinkDonate is integrated with several payment services and can <br>
                    run transactions for up to several hundred charities in one app. <br>
                    So it was essential to build not only a useful tool set for <br>
                    running campaigns but also make sure it was as secure and reliable <br>
                    as possible. To meet these requirements, the team picked <br>
                    microservices architecture, industry-proven cloud services, and <br>

                      Stress testing to measure peak load, set scalability <br>

                      keeping the infrastructure costs adequate.

                    requirements to design a system that would effortlessly sustain<br>
                    the expected max load without inflating the cost of resources. At<br>
                    the same time, the microservices approach to architecture supports<br>
                    effective and painless growth in the future.
